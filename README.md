`monies` is a daily budgeting tool

Here is how it works with a example: Suppose you have a vacation trip planned. Being trifty, you want to spend only 500 bucks for the 5 days of travel. That gives you a 100 per day

| day | expenses          | budget | spent  |
|-----|-------------------|--------|--------|
| 1   | beer, food...     | 100    | 40     |
| 2   | food, taxi...     | 160    | 20     |
| 3   | coffe, jet ski... | 220    | 230    |
| 4   | good food...      | 90     | 90     |
| 5   | souvenirs...      | 100    | 80     |
savings: 20 bucks!

As you can see some days you spent less than a 100, some days more, which in turn adjusted your budget for the next day -- and so on and so forth. In the end you spent less than your total budget

`monies` is the tool to keep track of all that. Log your expenses, see reports, set budgets per kind of expenses, add tags and location, calculate savings, and more!
